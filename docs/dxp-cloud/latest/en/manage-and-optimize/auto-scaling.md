# Auto-scaling

Liferay DXP Cloud's auto-scaling feature automatically creates and destroys 
instances of the DXP service as needed to optimize performance. This addresses 
sudden changes such as increased server traffic, memory leaks, or other issues. 
By default, this feature is *disabled* in every DXP Cloud account. 

Using this feature, a service can automatically increase (upscale) the number 
of Liferay DXP instances to a maximum of 10, or decrease (downscale) to the 
number specified in the `scale` property in 
[`LCP.json`](../reference/configuration-via-lcp-json.md). 
The `scale` property specifies the minimum number of instances to run: 

```json
  "scale": 2,
```

> **Note:** Currently, auto-scaling is only available for the Liferay DXP 
> service in production environments. 

> **Note:** For more information on how auto-scaling is charged, see

## Managing Auto-scaling

Follow these steps to enable or disable auto-scaling in the DXP Cloud Management 
Console: 

1. Navigate to the production environment. 
1. Navigate to *Services* &rarr; *Liferay* &rarr; *Scale*. 
1. If auto-scaling is disabled, click *Enable Auto Scaling* to enable it. If 
    auto-scaling is already enabled, click *Disable Auto Scaling* to disable it. 

With auto-scaling enabled, DXP Cloud monitors your service and scales it 
automatically according to predefined thresholds.

## Specifying Target Average Utilization

System administrators can specify a *target average utilization*. This value is
an average of memory and CPU usage across Liferay DXP services. That value 
threshold must be crossed before auto-scaling is triggered.

For example, if three service instances utilize 70%, 90%, and 95% of memory, 
respectively, then the average memory utilization is 85%. If the target average 
utilization is set to 90, then no upscaling is needed; upscaling in this 
situation only occurs when the average memory utilization exceeds the target. 

The total available memory is specified by the `memory` property in `LCP.json`, 
as referenced in 
[Configuration via LCP.json](../reference/configuration-via-lcp-json.md). 

Specify the target average utilization in the `autoscale` property of the 
service's `LCP.json`: 

```json
"autoscale": {
    "cpu": 80,
    "memory": 90
}
```

If the `autoscale` property isn't set, the target average utilization defaults 
to 80 for both CPU and memory utilization. 

## Handling Licenses

One common question about Auto Scaling is related to how Liferay DXP licenses 
are handled. The good news is that Liferay DXP Cloud already takes care of that 
for you. New licenses are added and removed as needed for Auto Scaling.
