## Changes to Docker Image Definitions

Docker images for your services in version 4.x of DXP Cloud are no longer defined in the project's `gradle.properties` file. They are now defined in the `LCP.json` for each service.

Upgrading to DXP Cloud Stack version 4 changes every service's Docker image version from `3.x.x` to `4.x.x`. These image changes are in addition to organizational changes to how DXP Cloud projects are structured and function.

## Project Organization Changes

The biggest change to the repository is that each service's files have been moved to a folder at the root of the repository. The `lcp` folder is removed and is no longer in the path for any of these services. These folders themselves have been reorganized to resemble a Liferay workspace structure. <!-- TODO: Point to workspace documentation -->

Several other files previously at the root of the repository (including `gradle.properties`, `build.gradle`, and `settings.gradle`) have also been moved into the `liferay` service.

## Liferay Service Changes

The `liferay` service folder now follows the functional structure of a Liferay Workspace. <!-- TODO: Point to workspace documentation -->

All configurations within the `liferay` service now belong in an environment-specific `configs` directory that corresponds to a project's DXP Cloud environments. Additionally, the `license` folder has been removed; add your licenses into the `deploy` folder instead.

The following table summarizes the new organization of your `liferay` service configurations:

| **Files** | **Location in 3.x** | **Location in 4.x** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Files for deployment | lcp/liferay/deploy/{ENV}/ | liferay/configs/{ENV}/deploy/ |
| OSGi configuration files (.cfg or .config) | lcp/liferay/config/{ENV}/ | liferay/configs/{ENV}/osgi/configs/ |
| Other configuration overrides | lcp/liferay/config/{ENV}/ | liferay/configs/{ENV}/ |
| Custom shell scripts | lcp/liferay/script/{ENV}/ | liferay/configs/{ENV}/scripts/ |
| Hotfixes and patching tools | lcp/liferay/hotfix/{ENV}/ | liferay/configs/{ENV}/patching/ |
| Licenses | lcp/liferay/license/{ENV}/ | lcp/configs/{ENV}/deploy/ |

```note::
   Files within the ``configs/{ENV}/`` directory will be copied as overrides into the ``LIFERAY_HOME`` directory in the Liferay container in DXP Cloud.
```

### Custom Script Execution

Scripts placed in `liferay/configs/{ENV}/scripts/` will now be run as the `liferay` user, rather than as a root user. If a script must be run as root, then the script must be added to the `Jenkinsfile` instead.

## Search Service Changes

All configurations within the `search` service now belong in an environment-specific `configs` directory. See the following table for the new organization of your `search` service configuration:

| **Files** | **Location in 3.x** | **Location in 4.x** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Elasticsearch configurations | lcp/search/config/{ENV}/ | search/configs/{ENV}/config/ |
| Custom shell scripts | lcp/search/script/{ENV}/ | search/configs/{ENV}/scripts/ |
| Elasticsearch license (.json) files | lcp/search/license/{ENV}/ | search/configs/{ENV}/license/ |

```note::
   Files in ``search/configs/{ENV}/`` will be copied as overrides into ``usr/shared/elasticsearch/`` in the Search container in DXP Cloud. For example, configurations in ``search/configs/{ENV}/config/``, such as ``elasticsearch.yml``, will be copied into ``usr/shared/elasticsearch/config/`` and override existing defaults.
```

### Elasticsearch Plugins

Elasticsearch plugins may now be installed to your `search` service. To see the installed Elasticsearch plugins, use the shell within the `search` service and run the following command:

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-plugin list
```

If you would like to install additional Elasticsearch plugins beyond the ones our image installs by default, you can set the `LCP_SERVICE_SEARCH_ES_PLUGINS` environment variable in your `search` service to a comma-delimited list of plugin names to be installed. They will be installed during the service's deployment.

## CI Service Changes

A default `Jenkinsfile` is no longer required in the repository, as a default pipeline is now defined. Any `Jenkinsfile` is now defined in the `ci` folder, rather than the root of the repository.

Multiple `Jenkinsfile` extension points are now available in the `ci` folder to define procedures at different stages of creating a build. <!-- TODO: Add reference to Jenkinsfile-specific article -->

## Webserver Service Changes

All configurations within the `webserver` service now belong in an environment-specific `configs` directory. Additionally, the `deploy` folder for static content has been removed; add your custom content into the `public` folder instead.

See the following table for the new organization of your `webserver` service configuration:

| **File** | **Location in 3.x** | **Location in 4.x** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webserver configurations | lcp/webserver/config/{ENV}/ | webserver/configs/{ENV}/conf.d/ |
| Custom scripts | lcp/webserver/script/{ENV}/ | webserver/configs/{ENV}/scripts/ |
| Static content | lcp/webserver/deploy/{ENV}/ | webserver/configs/{ENV}/public/ |

```note::
   Files in ``/webserver/configs/{ENV}/`` will be copied as overrides into ``/etc/nginx/`` in the webserver container in DXP Cloud. Files in ``/webserver/configs/{ENV}/public/`` will be copied as overrides into ``var/www/html/``.
```

### Webserver Configuration Overrides

You can customize the root location for the `webserver` service by adding a `liferay.conf` file into `webserver/configs/{ENV}/conf.d/`. This will override the default `liferay.conf` available in the `webserver` service image's container. Access the shell in the DXP Cloud Console to see the default `liferay.conf` file as a reference when customizing the root location.

```warning::
   Do not customize the root location using a file name other than ``liferay.conf``, so that this file specifically overrides the default ``liferay.conf``. Otherwise, both files may exist together in the container and two root locations may be found, causing an error.

   Other file names are instead used to define additional locations for your webserver.
```

You can also override the default NGINX configuration by adding an `nginx.conf` file into `webserver/configs/{ENV}/`. You can use this to further define the webserver's behavior. See the [official NGINX documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files/) for more information.

### Configuring the Public Directory

If you wish to add custom static content, then place these files in `webserver/configs/{ENV}/public/`. DXP Cloud will look for this public folder and copy all files inside of it to `/var/www/html`.

You will need to add additional locations within your `conf.d` folder to configure the public folder. For example, to add a `.html` file (such as `index.html`) to a new `webserver/configs/{ENV}/public/static` folder, add a unique `.conf` configuration file to `webserver/configs/{ENV}/conf.d` with the following content:

```apacheconf
location /static/ {
  root /var/www/html;
}
```

## Backup Service Changes

All configurations within the `backup` service now belong in an environment-specific `configs` directory. This mainly pertains to custom SQL scripts:

| **File** | **Location in 3.x** | **Location in 4.x** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom SQL scripts | lcp/backup/script/{ENV}/ | backup/configs/{ENV}/scripts/ |

## Known Limitations

The new stack does not contain a docker-compose file to spin up a local environment. However, we're planning a much better local development experience in the future.
