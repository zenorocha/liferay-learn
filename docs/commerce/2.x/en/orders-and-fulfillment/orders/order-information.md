# Order Information

Administrators can view and edit order information by clicking an order in the [_Orders_ menu](./orders-menu-reference-guide.md).

There are five tabs: _General_, _Payments_, _Shipments_, _Notes_, and _Emails_.

## General

You can manage and track the order's status from start to finish on the _General_ tab.

The _Payments_ tab tracks the order's transaction history, [payment method](../../store-administration/configuring-payment-methods/managing-payment-methods.md), and the payment status.

The _Notes_ tab displays notes that have been previously added to an order and allows new notes to be added, with an optional flag for private (Admin view only) notes.
