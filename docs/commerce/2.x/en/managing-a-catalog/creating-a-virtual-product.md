# Creating a Virtual Product

A Virtual Product is a non-tangible product that can be downloaded. Examples include a music file, a video, or an electronic publication. In some cases, a virtual product is defined by a set duration. These virtual products could also include warranties and service contracts. Virtual products may be sold individually or as part of a Grouped Product.

To learn how to configure inventory for your product, see: [Setting Inventory by Warehouse](./setting-inventory-by-warehouse.md).

### Add Product Specifications

[Product specifications](../managing-a-catalog/specifications.md) contain useful pieces of product information about the product, such as dimensions, color, weight, capacity, or almost any other attribute. Click the _Specifications_ sub-tab to add specifications.

### Upload Product Images and Attachments

[Product images](../managing-a-catalog/product-images.md) help to ensure that customers know what they are buying. Each product variant (SKU) can have their own associated product image. Click the _Images_ sub-tab to add all product images.

Store administrators can also add attachments that are associated with a particular product. Click the _Attachments_ sub-tab to add documents.

### Organize with Categories

[Product Categories](../managing-a-catalog/creating-a-new-product-category.md) are used to organize products. Product categories may be used to apply discounts or other offers to a set of products, to assist buyers in finding products, or to promote certain products to a specified account or account group.

### Associate with Related Products

[Product Relations](./related-products-up-sells-and-cross-sells.md) can be used to connect products. Once connected, a product displays the links to other products. Every related product must be assigned to a Product Relation Type.
