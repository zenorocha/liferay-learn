# Creating a New Catalog

A catalog is the complete list of related products that can be displayed on a store site. Store administrators can create multiple catalogs (each with their own corresponding currencies) on a single Liferay Commerce instance.

To create a new catalog:

1. Navigate to _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Catalogs_.
1. Click the Add (![Add icon](../images/icon-add.png)) button to add a new catalog.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: Medical Supplies
    * **Default Catalog Language**: (your Language) (for example, _English (United States)_)
    * **Currency**: (your store's currency) (_US Dollar_)

    ![New Catalog](./creating-a-new-catalog/images/01.png)

1. Click _Save_.

The new catalog has been created and will be selectable when adding a new product.
