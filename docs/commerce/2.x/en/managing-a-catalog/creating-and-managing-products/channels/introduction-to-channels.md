# Introduction to Channels

Liferay Commerce provides tools designed to meet the needs of complex B2B, multi-region, and multi-market stores and simpler B2C use cases. One way that Commerce enables a wide variety of use cases is through the _Channels_ feature.

In Liferay Commerce, Channels connect Catalogs and Products to any place products are sold: a Liferay Commerce based storefront, third party marketplaces, or back office phone sales. Using Channels, users manage product availability, sales, and fulfillment by Site and eventually by Country, Region, or Account Group. Channels must be associated to warehouses in order to track product availability and and sourcing for product shipping.

In a simple store example, all of a company's products are managed in one catalog and those products are distributed through a single channel: the company store site.

In a more complex multi-channel scenario, a company may choose to customize the availability and marketing of certain products in its catalog for each of its various channels.
