# Creating Tax Categories

Tax Categories are containers for one or more tax calculations in your store. Tax categories have to be created _first_ before applying any type of taxes.  Products can be taxed differently by assigning different tax categories to them.

To create a new tax category:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Settings_.
1. Click the _Tax Categories_ tab.

    ![Tax categories are located in the Commerce Settings.](./creating-tax-categories/images/03.png)

1. Click the Add Tax Category (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) button.
1. Enter the following:

    * **Name**: Holiday Special
    * **Description**: Taxes for holidays

A new tax category has been created.
