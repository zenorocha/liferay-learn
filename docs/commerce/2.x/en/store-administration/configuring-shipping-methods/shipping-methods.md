# Shipping Methods

Liferay Commerce supports several shipping methods and carriers. Before choosing any shipping method, verify the [Measurement Units](./measurement-units.md) that the store will use.

Here are several shipping methods:

* [Variable Rate](./using-the-variable-rate-shipping-method.md)
* [Flat Rate](./using-the-flat-rate-shipping-method.md)
* [FedEx](./using-the-fedex-shipping-method.md) (Subscribers)

For users interested in adding other shipping methods or carriers, see [Implementing a New Shipping Engine](../../developer-guide/tutorials/implementing-a-new-shipping-engine.md).

Shipping methods may be restricted by country or region. To learn more, see [Applying Shipping Method Restrictions](./applying-shipping-method-restrictions.md).
