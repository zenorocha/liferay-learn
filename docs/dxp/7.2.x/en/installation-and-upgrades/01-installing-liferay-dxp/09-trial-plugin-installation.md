# Trial Plugin Installation

Liferay DXP subscribers have access to plugins and add-ons that enhance the functionality and performance of Liferay DXP. Users who are evaluating DXP on a trial basis, may access these plugins for evaluation within the *Apps* &rarr; *Store* (i.e., Marketplace) section of the Control Panel in your product installation.

## Installation Process

Follow the steps below to install a trial plugin:

1. Register a `liferay.com` account account by visiting [Liferay's home page](https://www.liferay.com) (if necessary). Do this by clicking *Sign In/Create Account* button from the top right Profile button.

1. Start the DXP 7.2 instance.
1. After signing in as an Admin in your DXP 7.2 trial server, go to the Control Panel &rarr; *Apps* &rarr; *Store* and sign in to the Marketplace using your `liferay.com` account credentials. Authorize Marketplace to access your local account.

### Where are the *DXP 7.2 Trial Plugins?*

**A:** There is no such thing. The DXP 7.2 plugins in Liferay Marketplace are the same ones that you get to try out with your DXP 7.2 trial license for your portal. The DXP 7.2 license (trial or official DXP 7.2 subscriber) gives you access to the DXP 7.2 plugins. Also, there is no difference code-wise or release-wise between a DXP 7.2 trial installation and a regular DXP 7.2 non-trial installation. The only difference is the license.

### Why can't I go to liferay.com/marketplace?

Also, why can't I *purchase* from the Marketplace site?

**A:** DXP trial users must use the Marketplace from within the product's Control Panel (instructions above). You do not need to *purchase* any DXP plugins because if you access Marketplace from within the Control Panel, Marketplace sees that you have a DXP license installed and gives access to DXP plugins. Official DXP subscription customers (i.e., non trial) can log into `liferay.com` with their designated DXP subscriber login and access all DXP plugins through the Marketplace website.

### Why are the plugins under the Purchased tab?

If I click on the *DXP Marketplace* link, it does not let me get the DXP plugins.

**A:** Once you're signed into the Store, click on the *Purchased* tab, then click on the *EE* tab.

### What happens when DXP trial customers become official Liferay Digital Experience subscribers?

**A:** They can still complete the above process, or they can also visit the [Liferay Marketplace website](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace).

### Do DXP trial customers get the DXP source code?

**A:** No, they can only install the plugin. The DXP source code becomes available once they are official DXP 7.2 Enterprise subscribers.

### Can this process of installing DXP plugins be used from Liferay Portal CE (Community Edition)?

**A:** No, the Marketplace must detect that you are running DXP 7.2.
