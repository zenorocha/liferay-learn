## Viewing Translated Forms

Authenticated users that have configured a matching default language for the site now see the translated form by default.

![Authenticated users whose language settings are localized will see the form in their language.](./translating-forms/images/04.png)

If accessed in the [Form widget on a Liferay DXP page](../sharing-forms.md), the Form is displayed in the User’s language automatically. If there’s no translation available in a user's selected language, the default language of the Form is displayed.
