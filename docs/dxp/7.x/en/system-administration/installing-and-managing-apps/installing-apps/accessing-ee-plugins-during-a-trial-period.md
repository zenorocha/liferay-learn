# Accessing EE Plugins During a Trial Period

If you are evaluating DXP during a trial period, you can access certain EE plugins.

Here are the steps:

1. In the Control Panel, navigate to _Apps_ &rarr; _Store_.

1. Sign in with your liferay.com account.

    ```important::
       Purchasing apps requires that you have a `liferay.com <https://www.liferay.com>`_ account and agree to the Marketplace Terms of Use.
    ```

1. Once signed into the Store, click on the _Purchased_ link, and then click on the _EE_ tab.

A list of EE plugins appears. During your trial period, you can access and use these DXP EE plugins.

```note::
   During your trial period, plugin management for EE plugins is only available in the _Control Panel_; the _Purchased_ &rarr; _EE_ tab on the Marketplace website becomes available only after you've purchased an enterprise subscription.
```

```important::
   EE plugin source code is only available to you after you get an official enterprise subscription.
```
