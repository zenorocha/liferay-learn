# Subscribing to a Message Board

Users can receive email updates and in-product notifications by subscribing to a Message Board. By default, users are automatically subscribed to any threads they create and can opt in to subscribe to categories or specific threads via email or RSS feed.

## Subscribing to a Category or Thread

To subscribe to a thread or category:

1. On the _Message Boards_ widget (on a site page), click the _Actions_ icon next to a Category or Thread (in this example, _Category 1_)
1. Click _Subscribe_.

The user has now subscribed to _Category 1_. The user will be notified of any changes, such as new threads and subcategories being created under _Category 1_.
