## My Subscriptions

Subscribing to a thread causes Message Boards to send the user an email whenever a new message is posted to the thread. If you have enabled the mailing list feature for the thread's category, users can reply to these messages to post back to the thread without having to visit your site.

The _My Subscriptions_ tab displays all the categories and threads that the current user has subscribed to.
