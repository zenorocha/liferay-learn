## Social Tools

The following social applications are included with Liferay DXP:

* Contacts Center

These tools are building blocks for building an integrated, social experience for users. Activities provides a configurable feed of the actions users take on a site. Contacts Center allows users to search, view, and establish social relations with other users.

## Invitations

The _Invite Members_ widget lets Site Administrators send invitations to join the Site. When Users confirm such invitations, they become Site members assigned to the Roles defined by the site administrator. Click to learn more about [Site Membership](../site-building/01-building-sites/05-adding-members-to-sites.md).

Once the user has been invited, they can confirm or ignore the request.
