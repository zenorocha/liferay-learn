# Developer Tools Overview

Liferay's developer tools run the gamut from lightweight CLI utilities all the way to a full-blown IDE based on Eclipse. This is to serve all developers, whether you're just starting out or have been writing code for many years. All of Liferay's development tools work on Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms.

[Blade CLI](./blade-cli/installing-and-updating-blade-cli.md) makes it easy to create and build both standalone projects and Liferay Workspaces from your command line interface.

**Liferay Workspace** is an environment in your file system that holds your projects and their configurations. You can deploy to Liferay DXP, create and store Docker configurations, and perform all your DevOps from this single environment.

**Liferay Theme Generator** helps front-end developers create themes and layout templates to define the look and feel of your Liferay DXP-based site.

**Liferay JS Generator** creates projects for JavaScript-based widgets deployable to Liferay DXP.

**Liferay IntelliJ Plugin** provides support for using Liferay Workspaces and standalone projects in IntelliJ IDEA.

**Liferay Developer Studio** is an Eclipse-based IDE that supports the full scope of Liferay development.

Under the hood, Liferay Workspace is powered by a multitude of Gradle and Maven plugins you can apply to your projects. There are also project templates and samples to get you started.

The sample projects provided with the developer documentation are small, standalone projects, intentionally simplified to help you learn Liferay DXP's features and APIs. When you're ready to create your own projects, experienced developers should install Blade CLI to create a Liferay Workspace, IntelliJ users should install the IntelliJ plugin, and everyone else should install Liferay Developer Studio.

We hope you'll enjoy using Liferay's development tools with your Liferay projects!
