# Configuring the Recycle Bin

The Recycle Bin supports instance-wide scope or site-specific scope. By default, the Recycle Bin is enabled instance-wide.

```tip::
   You can disable the Recycle Bin on a specific site. If you disable the Recycle Bin while it is still holding recycled items, the recycled items remain stored and reappear in the Recycle Bin if it is re-enabled.
```

To configure the Recycle Bin:

1. Open the _Product Menu_ (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) then click the compass icon (![Compass](../../../images/icon-compass.png)) on the _Site Administration_ menu.
1. Select the site.
1. Click _Configuration_ &rarr; _Settings_.
