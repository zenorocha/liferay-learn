# Adding Web Content Articles

Web content is the most practical method of creating content to Users in DXP. Once they are created, web content articles can be displayed through widgets on pages, or on special [display pages](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029133291-Creating-Display-Page-Templates) designed specifically to display the content.

All web content articles are based on a structure that defines the fields available to it. <!-- TODO: See the [Introduction to Web Content Structures](../web-content-structures/introduction-to-web-content-structures.md) for more information.--> DXP provides one default structure out-of-the-box, _Basic Web Content._ The steps below will use this default structure.

1. Open the Site menu and navigate to _Content & Data_ → _Web Content._
