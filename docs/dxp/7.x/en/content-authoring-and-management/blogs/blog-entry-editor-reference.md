# Blog Entry Editor Reference

The blog entry editor provides context appropriate editing tools for formatting text, managing images, tables, and other rich features. Users are able to switch to code view to directly edit the content’s HTML. All draft entries are automatically saved every 25 seconds.

## Using the Editor’s Text View

The Text view is a WYSIWYG editor that lets you enter and edit text and other types of content.

To style or format text in the _Content_ area, select the text. A toolbar appears above the text that contains the following options:
