Sites are a fundamental component of Liferay DXP. At its core, a Site is a collection of pages that contains content. However, a Site can also contain applications that provide additional functionality for the page---many are available for you to use out-of-the-box. Liferay DXP includes powerful features that you can harness to streamline the Site creation process and create rich and personalized experiences for users.
