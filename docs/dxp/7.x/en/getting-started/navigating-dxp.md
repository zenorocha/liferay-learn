# Navigating DXP

Liferay DXP's out-of-the-box navigation is organized into two major areas: the _Personal Menu_ and the _Product Menu_.

## Personal Menu

The Personal Menu is the hub for information and activities for a user that is logged in.

Users can use the personal menu to:

* [Change account information](./introduction-to-the-admin-account.md#changing-account-information) (Name, Password, etc.)
* [See what sites they are members of](../site-building/building-sites/adding-members-to-sites.md)
* [Review site notifications](../collaboration-and-social/notifications-and-requests/user-guide/managing-notifications-and-requests.md)
* [Sign out](./introduction-to-the-admin-account.md#signing-out)
* And more...

## Product Menu

The DXP Product menu contains the _Control Panel_ and the _Site Menu_.

```note::
   By default, users with the *Guest* or *User* roles are not be able to access the Product Menu.
```

### Control Panel

The _Control Panel_ contains general administrative actions and configurations that apply _globally_ to the Liferay DXP installation.

The following common administrative activities can be done in the Control Panel:

* [Create new Sites](../site-building/introduction-to-site-building.md)
* Add new Custom Fields to applications on the site

### Site Menu

The DXP _Site Menu_ drop down contains actions, content, and configurations that are scoped to the specific site that is being currently viewed.

```note::
   The *Site Menu* indicates which site you are working with when using the Site Menu. In this example the site is `Liferay DXP`. You may change what site you are working with by clicking the Compass Icon in the Site Menu.
```

The following common site building and management activities can be done in the _Site Menu_:
