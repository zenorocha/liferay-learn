# Using the Script Engine

DXP provides a robust script engine for executing [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) scripts. You can execute scripts to perform maintenance tasks like data cleanup, user maintenance operations, bulk Liferay API invocations, or even system level operations in the Script Console.

![Figure 1: The Script Console provides context variables, such as the current actionRequest and lets you invoke Liferay services using Groovy. ](./using-the-script-engine/images/groovy-script-current-user-info.png)

Here are the scripting topics: 

- [Invoking Liferay services](./invoking-liferay-services-from-scripts.md)

- [Running scripts from the Script Console](./running-scripts-from-the-script-console.md)

- [Using the script engine with workflow](./using-the-script-engine-in-workflow.md)

- [Script examples](./script-examples.md)

The scripting console is most commonly used to invoke Liferay's services, so that's covered first.
